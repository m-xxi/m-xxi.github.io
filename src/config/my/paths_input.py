#*?, +?, ??
#The '*', '+', and '?' quantifiers are all greedy; they match as much text as possible. Sometimes this behaviour isnâ€™t desired; if the RE <.*> is matched against '<a> b <c>', it will match the entire string, and not just '<a>'. Adding ? after the quantifier makes it perform the match in non-greedy or minimal fashion; as few characters as possible will be matched. Using the RE <.*?> will match only '<a>'.
