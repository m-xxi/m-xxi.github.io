We wish you a happy birth day

CONTINUA
sonriendo cuando eres feliz

Endúlzanos con tu baile
Endúlzanos con tus sueños
Es hermoso verte 
volar ligero, volar libre.

KEEP ON
smiling when you are happy
KEEP ON
enjoying everyday


Delight us with your dance
Delight us with your dreams
It’s beautiful to see you
fly light, fly free 


KEEP ON 
dreaming while you dance 
KEEP ON
dancing while you dream


Share with us your thoughts 
Share with us your doubts
You must know we are listening
even though we might look tough


KEEP ON
questioning our thoughts
KEEP ON 
thinking our answers


Strive for your best
Relax to enjoy
Whatever results
it helps you to grow


KEEP ON
playing while you learn
KEEP ON
learning while you play


Go with us to the mountains
Go with us to the sea
Lets meet together the wonders
of this world we live in


KEEP ON
wondering where to go
KEEP ON 
wondering with what you see


Either barefoot in the sand
or with boots in the snow
You should know each step counts
to get you where you want to go


KEEP ON
Walking in the sand or in the snow
KEEP ON
Walking to fulfill your goals
